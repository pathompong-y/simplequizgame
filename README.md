# Simple Multiple Choices Quiz Game

This project was created while I was practicing creating simple game using jQuery targeting to run on mobile browser with 3 days time limit.
The intention is to gamify any boring quiz to be more entertaining way.

You can see the demo of it here. It is used in one of the event held many years ago.

# Instructions to run

Download all of the files and folders to your computer and run from index.html on your browser.
Please make sure to reduce the browser width to similar width as mobile phone as the graphics layout in the repository is design primarily for mobile.
