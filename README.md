# Simple Multiple Choices Quiz Game

This project was created while I was practicing creating simple game using jQuery targeting to run on mobile browser with 3 days time limit.
The intention is to gamify any boring quiz to be more entertaining way.

You can see the demo of it here. It is used in one of the event held many years ago.
